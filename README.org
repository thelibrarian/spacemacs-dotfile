* My Spacemacs Config

This is my config file for [[https://spacemacs.org][Spacemacs]]. There are many like it, but this one is
mine.

Main things I have done:

1. Grouped enabled layers as per the [[http://spacemacs.org/doc/LAYERS.html][layers list]].
2. Set default theme to Leuven
3. Configured org-mode:
   1. Set some defaults
   2. Added a project for publishing
   3. Set some capture templates
 
P.S. I pronounce "spacemacs" "spah-cheh-macs".
